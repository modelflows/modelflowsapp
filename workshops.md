title: ModelFLOWs Workshop
subtitle: The annual event of our research group
---

We are excited to announce ModelFLOWs workshop, which intends to be an annual event for our group of investigation. The event, held in Madrid, showed inspiring presentations showcasing cutting-edge advancements in fluid dynamics and data-driven modeling.

The given talks focused on innovative AI strategies, presenting new models based on physical principles with applications in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), personalized medicine, air pollution, and combustion processes. These models are capable of identifying complex patterns, are robust and generalizable, and can be used to accelerate CFD codes, enhance database resolution, and reconstruct corrupted data. 

A key aspect highlighted during the sessions was the explainability of these models, directly linked to the underlying physics of the studied phenomena, which plays a crucial role in demonstrating their excellent performance and their potential to advance the state-of-the-art in each application domain.
