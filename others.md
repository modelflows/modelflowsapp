## Data Assimilation <a id="DA"></a>
Accurate predictions in **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)** rely on precise modeling of fluid behavior, yet uncertainties in simulations often limit their reliability. **Data Assimilation (DA)** helps bridge this gap by combining experimental data with numerical models to refine predictions. However, DA can be computationally expensive, particularly for large-scale applications where **high-resolution (HR)** simulations demand significant resources.
Our research introduces a novel **Reduced-Order Model (ROM)** that merges experimental data and numerical simulations using **DA** to enhance **CFD** predictions. By implementing the **Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF)** within a **reduced-dimension framework**, we enable accurate state estimation from limited observations while significantly reducing computational costs. Our method applies **low-resolution (LR)** techniques, including **dataset downsampling** and advanced **reconstruction** methods like **low-cost Singular Value Decomposition (lcSVD)** and **Multi-Dimensional Interpolation (MDI)**, to efficiently restore high-resolution details. The **lcSVD** approach, never before applied to **DA**, provides an innovative way to improve accuracy with minimal computational overhead. This strategy demonstrates that the framework is both **accurate** and **computationally efficient**, making it suitable for **real-time** and **large-scale** fluid dynamics applications. The method will be integrated into the next version of **ModelFLOWs-app**, enhancing its capabilities for industrial and environmental simulations.

## LcSVD-Data Assimilation <a id="lcSVD_DA"></a>
One of the primary challenge associated with the industrial datasets is their heterogeneous nature. The experimental database is normally generated by assimilating the information extracted from a series of sensors placed in the dynamical system. Unlike the sparsely resolved spatial data obtained through experiments we can generate highly resolved spatial information of systems through simulations. These two datasets (experimental and theoretical) independently hold significant information about the combustion system. This mandates the need for a mathematical framework for data assimilation that can simultaneously analyze both datasets by extracting physical information, complementing data, correcting divergent tendencies, and addressing spurious measurements. Low-Cost Singular Value Decomposition (Low-Cost SVD) refers to efficient approximations of the standard SVD algorithm, which reduce computational cost and memory usage while preserving the most important information. These methods are particularly useful for large-scale datasets, high-dimensional data, and real-time applications. In this work low-cost singular value decomposition (lcSVD) is used as a methodology to perform data assimilation.

## Spatio Temporal Koopman Decomposition (STKD) <a id="STKD"></a>
The Spatio-Temporal Koopman Decomposition (STKD) extends the High-Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD) by enabling spatio-temporal analysis of multidimensional data. It represents spatio-temporal fields as combinations of traveling wave modes, each characterized by specific wavenumbers and spatial growth rates, forming intricate standing or propagating patterns. STKD accommodates expansions along multiple spatial dimensions, allowing complex dynamics to be captured across directions such as spanwise and streamwise.In the context of traveling waves, this decomposition allows us to describe how spatial patterns evolve over time in terms of their fundamental modes.STKD analysis helps us understand

a) Dominant Wavenumbers and Frequencies: Identifying which spatial wavenumbers and temporal frequencies dominate the dynamics.
b) Growth and Decay: Modes with positive/negative growth rates  indicate whether a wave pattern is amplifying or decaying over time.
