## Adaptive prediction
Large Eddy Simulations (LES) have been widely used in various scenarios due to their capability of capturing more detailed flow fields than those captured by Reynolds-Averaged Navierâ€“Stokes (RANS) and consuming fewer computational resources than Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS). However, for applications involving large-scale devices and combustion, huge computational resources are still required. Recent developments in machine learning have introduced innovative methods for accelerating Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Among these, the adaptive method combining CFD and hybrid reduced order models (ROMs) is a promising way to accelerate the simulations. This approach not only enhances our fundamental understanding of combustion patterns but also paves the way for innovative strategies to improve the combustion efficiency.

## LcSVD-DA
One of the primary challenge associated with the combustion datasets is their heterogeneous nature. The experimental database is normally generated by assimilating the information extracted from a series of sensors placed in the dynamical system. Unlike the sparsely resolved spatial data obtained through experiments we can generate highly resolved spatial information of combustion systems through large eddy simulations (LES) or direct numerical simulations (DNS).
These two datasets (experimental and theoretical) independently hold significant information about the combustion system.LcSVD data assimilation is a mathematical framework for data assimilation that can simultaneously analyze both datasets by extracting physical information, complementing data, correcting divergent tendencies, and addressing spurious measurements.

For validation purposes, we perform LES and adaptive prediction on a typical jet in hot coflow burner used by Dally et al.
