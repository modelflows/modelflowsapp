Outline

## HOSVD
The Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) is a generalization of the standard SVD to tensors, 
enabling the decomposition of multi-dimensional data into a core tensor and orthonormal factor matrices along each mode.
This method is widely used in modal decomposition, data compression, and feature extraction, particularly in fields dealing with high-dimensional datasets such as fluid dynamics and biomedical imaging. 
By capturing dominant structures in data, HOSVD facilitates reduced-order modeling and pattern recognition while preserving key spatial and temporal correlations.
