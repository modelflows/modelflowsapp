## Flow Past a Cylinder <a id="cylinder"></a>

### 2D Laminar Flow <a id="cylinder-2d"></a>
This database contains data from a two-dimensional CFD simulation of the flow past a circular cylinder. The flow is laminar, with six diferent Reynolds number of 50, 60, 85, 100, 130 and 160. The simulation was conducted using Nek5000.
